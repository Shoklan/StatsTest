There are two versions of the program because I felt it was disengenious to include only one. There is a slight difference in the statistics when you remove the person you picked from the sample after you took his information. So, there they both are.

The results are still close enough for the sake of accuracy,; neither one shows a result that would make me wrong. So, there's that.

And, I like winning. That's all.
